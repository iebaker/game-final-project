Restitution: 
	This is covered in the smt3.gamengine.physics classes. Entities have coefficients of restitution and they're applied during collisions.
Raycasting: 
	You can witness this by clicking the mouse during the game. Individual shape classes have raycast methods.

GAME REQS

Collisions:
	Elastic: The ball and the triangular platform are both perfectly elastic
	Inelastic: The boxes are partially elastic.
	Perfectly Inelastic: The purple balls are perfectly inelastic.
Firing Bullets:
	They're more like lasers, really. Click in any direction to fire a laser there. It will apply an impulse to the first entity in its path, other than its source.
Tossing Grenades:
	Press shift to fire a grenade in the direction of the mouse. I iterated around in a circle, shooting out 100 rays (instead of just checking individual objects), because then things that are more in the blast-path get propelled more.
Jumping Correctly:
	Try jumping around by pressing space. It seems to work pretty well. The code is in the player class (using the last MTV, stored in the Entity class)
