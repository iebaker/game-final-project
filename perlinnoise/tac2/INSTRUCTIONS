TAC 2 instructions!

There are two teams: sticks and stones (sticks are brown, stones are gray but really the gray looks almost brown, too :( ).  For the purposes of demosntrating, the user can place entities of both types.

STICK entities:
StickBuilder: click to place, click to select.  When selected, right click elsewhere to enqueue build locations.  The builder will then move to those locations and build StickWall entities there.

StickSoldier: click to place, click to select.  When selected, right click elsewhere to enqueue patrol locations.  The soldier will loop between these places firing bullets at random.

STONE entities:
StoneBuilder: click to place, click to select.  Will not accept enqueued locations.  AI tells these to first build a 5 long wall, then a 1 long wall, then a 20 long wall at random locations.

StoneSoldier: click etc... the AI creates different patrol locations based on the terrain type the Soldier is on.

All the other stuff -- there are "Sticks" and "Stones" and "Ammo" entities that appear randomly in the world... In a young and naive time I envisioned a resource-based gameplay mechanic but this fell by the wayside :(
