NECESSARY

Saving
	Fix sound issue when reloading

Water
	Swim up and down, no jumping off floor, more of it!
	
Entities
	Make them dark gray instead, but implement radial gradient that makes them fade to black if too far away (for water too!)

Light
	Circles - make em work
	Weird right edge bug
	Working for when roof is gone? (if time)

----------------------------------------------------
THINGS THAT COULD BE ADDED (REMOVE ONCE IMPLEMENTED)

Make world loop on left and right sides
	Implementation? Could this be done with some sort of mod in the viewport? Dylan, do you know?

Clean up cutscene UI
	The setup for cutscenes is pretty simple, so I think anyone could do this. Just better management of the UIRoundedRect and UIText in the TetBox class.
	Look in the GameScreen class, too. Some of the management is there.
	
Clean up general UI
	I think the front screen could look a little bit nicer for the final submission. Maybe add a credits page too or something. And "load game" and "new game" options.
	
More abilities
	Digging, flying, being able to move objects by dragging them with the mouse, really anything.
	Once abilities are there, we can start to introduce them to the game and build content around them.
	
Saving
	Save files to an actual folder instead of just putting it in "home"
	
Font
	Fix weird edges and switching fonts as you load

Water
	Oxygen countdown?
