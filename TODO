THINGS THAT COULD BE ADDED (REMOVE ONCE IMPLEMENTED)

Make world loop on left and right sides
	Implementation? Could this be done with some sort of mod in the viewport? Dylan, do you know?

Clean up cutscene UI
	The setup for cutscenes is pretty simple, so I think anyone could do this. Just better management of the UIRoundedRect and UIText in the TetBox class.
	Look in the GameScreen class, too. Some of the management is there.
	
Clean up general UI
	I think the front screen could look a little bit nicer for the final submission. Maybe add a credits page too or something. And "load game" and "new game" options.
