INSTRUCTIONS

Welcome to Umbra!

Start game by clicking the new game button or pressing enter. You're 
the last of your race left on the planet, and everything around you is
shrouded in darkness. You have some light, but there's only one remaining
source of light in the world. Explore around to see what you can do to 
fix that...

- Zoom the view by scrolling with the mouse
- Move the player by holding left or right arrow keys, or A and D
- Jump by pressing the space bar or W
- Shoot lasers with the left mouse button

Bounce around and have fun!
